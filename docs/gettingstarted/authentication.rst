Introduction
=============

Pump.io uses oauth 1.0 with dynamic client registration, this available through a lot of libraries, PyPump currently uses a modified version of `Leah Culver <https://github.com/leah/python-oauth/>`, the modified version is called `oauth3000 <https://github.com/xray7224/oauth3000>`. All of that is handled by PyPump however there are some things to know.

Oauth works by exchanging a pre-established key and secret, you however have to provide those each time you make instantiate the PyPump object. You will have to provide a mechanism to store these so that you can you can provide them the next time.

Example
-------

The following will create (for the first time) a connection to a pump.io server for the user Tsyesika@pump.megworld.co.uk for my client named "Test.io"::

    >>> from PyPump.PyPump import PyPump
    >>> pump = PyPump("Tsyesika@pump.megowrld.co.uk", client_name="Test.io", secure=True)
    >>> client_credentials = pump.get_registration() # will return [<client key>, <client secret>, <expirey>]
    >>> client_tokens = pump.get_token() # will return [<token>, <secret>]

.. note:: If you're not using CLI you will need to override the *get_access* method on PyPump to ask for their varification token

An example of then connecting again (using the same variable names as above). This will produce a PyPump object which will use the same credentials as established above::

    >>> pump = PyPump(
    ...          "pump.megworld.co.uk",
    ...          key=client_credentials[0], # the client key
    ...          secret=client_credentials[1], # the client secret
    ...          token=client_tokens[0], # the token key
    ...          token_secret=client_tokens[1], # the token secret
    ...          secure=True) # for using HTTPS
