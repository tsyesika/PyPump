Introduction
------------

.. warning:: This is not complete, this is used as a fast intro for those fairly familiar or a reference for those who are a little rusty with PyPump

This guide is designed to get you up to speed and using this library in a very short amount of time, to do that I avoid long winded explanations, if you're completely new to PyPump and/or pump.io please use :doc:`tutorial`.

Getting connected
-----------------

So we need to get started::

    >>> from pypump import PyPump

First time lets do all the oauth stuff::

    >>> pump = PyPump("me@my.server.org", client_name="Quick 'n dirty")

Super, next, I wanna see my inbox::

    >>> me = pump.Person("me@my.server.org")
    >>> my_inbox = me.inbox
    >>> for activity in my_inbox[:20]:
    ...     print activity

.. note:: using an index or slice makes the request. If you iterate over it without a request it **will** be empty,

Oh, my friend Evan isn't there, I probably need to follow him::

    >>> evan = pump.Person("evan@e14n.org")
    >>> evan.follow()

Awesome. Lets check again::

    >>> for activity in my_inbox[:20]:
    ...     print activity

Evan likes PyPump, super!::

    >>> activity = my_inbox[1] # second activity in my inbox
    >>> awesome_note = activity.obj
    >>> awesome_note.content
    'Oh wow, PyPump is awesome!'
    >>> awesome_note.like()

I wonder if someone else has liked that::

    >>> awesome_note.likes
    [me@my.server.org, joar@some.other.server]

Cool! Lets tell them about these docs::

    >>> my_comment = pump.Comment("Guys, if you like PyPump check out the docs!")
    >>> awesome_note.comment(my_comment)

I wonder what was posted last::

    >>> latest_activity = my_inbox[0]
    >>> print latest_activity
    <Activity: jrobb posted an image>

Oh it's an image, lets see the thumb nail::

    >>> url = latest_activity.obj.thumb_url
    >>> fout = open("some_image.{0}".format(url.split(".")[-1], "wb")
    >>> import urllib2 # this will be different with python3
    >>> fout.write(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> fout.close()

Hmm, I want to see a bigger version::

    >>> large_url = latest_activity.obj.full_url
    >>> print large_url
    <Image at https://some.server/uploads/somefriend/2013/7/7/JkdX2.png">
    >>> # you will find Images often hold other pump.Image objects, we just need to extra the url
    >>> large_url = large_url.url
    >>> fout = open("some_image_larger.{0}".format(large_url.split(".")[-1], "wb")
    >>> fout.write(urllib2.urlopen(url).read())
    >>> fout.close()

That looks awesome, lets post a comment::

    >>> my_comment = pump.Comment("Great, super imaeg")
    >>> latest_activity.obj.comment(my_comment)

Oh no, I made a typo::

    >>> my_comment.delete()
    >>> my_comment.content = "Great, super image")
    >>> latest_activity.obj.comment(my_comment)

Much better! Lets make a note to tell people how easy this all is::

    >>> my_note = pump.Note("My gawd... PyPump is super easy to get started with")
    >>> my_note.send()

But hold on though, that only sent it to followers? What gives::

    >>> awesome_pump = pump.Note("PyPump is really awesome!")
    >>> awesome_pump.to = pump.Public
    >>> awesome_pump.cc = (pump.Followers, pump.Following, pump.Person("MyFriend@server.com"))
    >>> awesome_pump.send()

Oh cool that's sent to all my friends, So can i make my own lists::

    >>> for my_list in pump.List.all():
    ...    print my_list.name
    Coworkers
    Family
    Friends

Oh are all those my lists that are defined. How do I send a note to them?::

    >>> new_note = pump.Note("Work sucks!")
    >>> new_note.to = pump.List("Coworkers")
    >>> new_note.cc = pump.List("Friends)

So, can i send something to all of of the groups I made? Yep::

    >>> another_note = pump.Note("This really goes to everyone in my groups?")
    >>> another_note.to = pump.List.all()
    >>> another_note.cc = (pump.Person("moggers87@microca.st"), pump.Person("cwebber@identi.ca"))
    >>> another_note.send()
